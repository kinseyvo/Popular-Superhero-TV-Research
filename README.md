# Data Science Analysis of Popular Superhero TV Shows
## Description ##
Utilizing [data found online](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anoopkumarraut/most-popular-superhero-tv-shows), I wanted to analyze Superhero TV shows and see which ones are more popular or in-demand than others. Additionally, I was looking to find if the type of genre has a factor in how popular a Superhero show is.
## Evaluation ##
- Had to account for duplicate listings and unreleased shows
    - About 36 unreleased shows
- Multi-genres such as Animation, Action, and Adventure occurred significantly more than other multi-genres
- 6 and 7 were the most common IMDb ratings
- TV-Y7 and TV-PG are the most common parental guidelines since most shows are primarily directed towards a younger audience
